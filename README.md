🔒 Privacy & Data Transparency
We do not collect names, emails, IPs, or identifying metadata unless you choose to include them.

This project is open-source. You can inspect, fork, and verify the source code at any time. No data is sold, shared, or stored outside GitHub or the secure Google Form backend. Data is used solely to detect patterns of systemic abuse.

If you're unsure—submit anonymously. Specific offices can still be identified through non-identifying trends.

⚖️ Legal & Strategic Basis
This initiative leverages pattern-of-treatment evidence under federal EEO doctrine. Individual cases lose 98.3% of the time. But collective patterns form the basis for:

Class action viability

Media pressure campaigns

DOJ/OIG referrals

Congressional oversight triggers

This is a non-commercial, public-interest effort to expose institutional abuse inside USPS.
