    <!-- Chosen Palette: Consistent with Submit Statement Page (Blue, Green, Gray) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a thematic, single-page dashboard structure. It guides the user from a high-level overview of the EEO landscape, through an interactive visualization of the complaint process, into a detailed analysis of successful vs. unsuccessful case factors, and concludes with actionable strategic advice. This structure was chosen to transform the dense report into an intuitive, task-oriented tool. Users can immediately grasp the core challenges, understand the procedural journey, and explore specific evidence types or procedural failures without reading the entire document linearly, making the information more accessible and strategically useful. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: FY2021 Complaint stats vs. Findings. Goal: Compare. Viz: Doughnut Chart. Interaction: Tooltips. Justification: Visually dramatizes the gap between complaints filed and successful findings, a core theme of the report. Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: EEO Complaint Process. Goal: Organize. Viz: HTML/CSS Flowchart. Interaction: Click to expand details/timelines. Justification: Simplifies the complex, multi-stage legal process into an easy-to-follow, interactive map. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Key evidence types and USPS procedural failures. Goal: Organize/Inform. Viz: Interactive two-column layout. Interaction: Clickable cards revealing detailed text. Justification: Allows users to quickly scan key factors and drill down into specific areas of interest, making the analysis actionable. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.
